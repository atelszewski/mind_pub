# The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything

This repo contains my notes on stuff I'd like to remember, or more precisely, it provides a way to recall what I've once learnt, but memory cells might fail to preserve.

The repo name contains _mind_, that's inspired by [MindForger] and _pub_ -- which stands for publicly available.
